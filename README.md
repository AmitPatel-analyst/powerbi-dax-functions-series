# Power BI DAX Function Series

Welcome to the Power BI DAX Function Series Repository! 

This repository serves as an interactive complement to the blog posts on my website [EthanGuyant.com](https://ethanguyant.com) and 
[Inquisitive Nature on Medium](https://medium.com/inquisitive-nature) focused on exploring DAX Functions in Power BI.

Here, you can dive deeper into your exploration and practice working with various DAX functions in Power BI. Inside, you'll find a Power BI Report pre-loaded with sample data containing pages corresponding to different blog posts, and an Excel workbook with sample data if you would prefer to start from scratch.

## Repository Contents

In this repository, you will find:
1) `power-bi-function-seris.pbix`: A Power BI report file that includes the sample data used in the blog posts and is pre-loaded with the functions discussed. It serves as a sandbox for you to explore and experiment with the functions.
2)  `sample-data.xlsx`: The raw dataset we used for the examples. You can use this to create your own Power BI report from scratch if you prefer.

## What You Will Learn

The Power BI Report has a page corresponding to each related post and will be updated as new topics and functions are covered. So check back soon, and check back often.

1) **CALCULATE:** One of the most powerful functions in DAX. You will learn how to use the CALCULATE function to create new measures and manipulate filters.

   The post can also be found on Medium [here](https://medium.com/inquisitive-nature/unlocking-the-secrets-of-calculate-a-deep-dive-into-advanced-data-analysis-in-power-bi-62ed1bb740e3)
2) **Time Intelligence Functions:** These functions help you work with data that has a time element. You will learn how to create calculated measures that leverage the time element in you data.

## Getting Started

To get started:
1) Clone or download this repository (or .pbix) to your local machine.
2) Open the `power-bi-function-series.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
3) Explore the data and the DAX formula examples.
4) Try creating your own measures or visualizations based on what you've learned.

## Prerequisites

To make the most out of these resources, you should have:
* A basic understanding of Power BI and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
* Power BI Desktop installed on your computer. You can download it for free from the [official Microsoft website](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/).


***Please note:** The repository assumes that the user has a basic understanding of Power BI and DAX functions. If you're completely new to these concepts, I recommend going through the introductory materials available on the [Microsoft Learn for Power BI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/powerplatform/power-bi?WT.mc_id=powerbi_landingpage-docs-link).*
